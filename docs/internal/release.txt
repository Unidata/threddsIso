Making a threddsIso release in preparation for a THREDDS release

1. threddsIso and THREDDS have a circular dependency. To resolve it,
   we're going to have to build temporary THREDDS artifacts.
     a) In THREDDS, manually change the version, e.g. from "4.6.1-SNAPSHOT" to "4.6.1".
     b) Do not update the ncwms or threddsIso dependencies, as we haven't yet built the new versions.
        We're kind of cheating here.
     c) "gradlew publishToMavenLocal". This will install new THREDDS artifacts in your local Maven repository.
        We'll use these to deploy new versions of ncwms and threddsIso.
     d) Revert all of the changes you've made. For the actual THREDDS release,
        we'll (eventually) be running the gradle-release-plugin on Jenkins.
2. In threddsIso, update the versions of any SNAPSHOT dependencies.
   For example, "2.2.6-SNAPSHOT" -> "2.2.6". Commit the change.
3. Create a tag for the release, e.g. "v2.2.6". In IntelliJ, do VCS->Git->Tag...
4. "mvn deploy". You'll need the proper credentials in ~/.m2/settings.xml in order to deploy to Nexus.
5. Update versions again for development, e.g. "2.2.6" -> "2.2.7-SNAPSHOT". Commit the change.
6. Push the changes upstream. Be sure to include the tag you created.
   In IntelliJ, check the "Push Tags" box in the "Push Commits" dialog.

Steps 2-6 are very similar to the procedure that the maven-release-plugin is intended to perform.
However, I cannot get it to work on Windows: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26644373

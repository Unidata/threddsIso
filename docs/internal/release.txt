Making a threddsIso release in preparation for a THREDDS release

1. threddsIso and the TDS have a circular dependency. To resolve it, we're going to have to build temporary THREDDS artifacts.
     a) In the TDS, change the version from "5.2-SNAPSHOT" to "5.2".
     b) Do not update the ncwms or threddsIso dependencies, as we haven't yet built the new versions.
        We're kind of cheating here.
     c) "gradlew publishToMavenLocal".
        This will install new THREDDS artifacts in your local Maven repository.
        We'll use these to deploy new versions of ncwms and threddsIso.
2. In threddsIso, pull all changes from main.
3. Update the versions of any SNAPSHOT dependencies (dont' forget about the netCDF-Java and
   TDS dependencies).
   For example, "2.4.2-SNAPSHOT" -> "2.4.2". Commit the change.
   git add --all
   git commit -m "Release 2.4.2"
4. Create a tag for the release, e.g. "v2.4.2".
   git tag v2.4.2 <commmit-hash-for release>
5. "mvn deploy". You'll need the proper credentials in ~/.m2/settings.xml in order to deploy to Nexus.
6. Update versions again for development, e.g. "2.4.2" -> "2.4.3-SNAPSHOT" (dont' forget about the
   netCDF-Java and TDS dependencies).
   Also, update the project README.
   Commit the change.
   git add pom.xml
   git commit -m "Begin work on 2.4.3-SNAPSHOT"
7. Push the changes upstream. Be sure to include the tag you created.
